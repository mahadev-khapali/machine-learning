    "IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) is an interactive, collaborative, cloud-based environment where data scientists can use multiple tools to achieve insights. Data scientists can use the best of open source, tap into IBM's unique features, grow their skills, and collaborate with teams. \n",
    "One of the many features of DSX provides the capability to create and train a machine learning model in DSX with little to no coding. This model can subsequently be saved and deployed to Watson Machine Learning on IBM Bluemix and called for scoring in real-time. \n",
    "This tutorial is a continuation of the logistic regression analysis tutorial at: \n",
    "https://datascience.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/ml-example-log-regress.html \n",
    "which creates, trains, saves and deploys a logistic regression model that predicts the possibility for a tent purchase based on age, sex, marital status and job profession for an individual. In this tutorial, a very simple Python Flask web application front end will be created to call this deployed model in real time. \n",

    "This notebook and the corresponding tutorial sections require several IBM Bluemix services. \n",
    "\n",
    "- An Apache Spark instance which was created with your Data Science Experience account\n",
    "- An Object Storage instance which was also created with your Data Science Experience account\n",

    "- A Python Flask instance which will be created later as part of this tutorial\n",

    "To run the code samples in this notebook, you must supply information, such as the URL, username, password, and scoring endpoint variables from your environment. The details on how to do this are described in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log in to your **Bluemix** account and, from the dashboard, select the **IBM Watson Machine Learning** service that you created.\n",
    "2. Click **Service credentials**.\n",
    "3. Click **View credentials** and then copy the values from the **URL**, **username**, and **password** fields to the corresponding `URL`, `username`, and `password` variables in the code cells in this notebook. \n",
    "4. To find the scoring endpoint, log in to **Data Science Experience**.\n",
    "5. Click **Projects** and from the list, click your project.\n",
    "6. On the **Analytics Assets** tab, in the **Models** section, click the model.\n",
    "7. In the **Deployments** section, click the model deployment and then, on the **Details** tab, copy the  **Scoring End Point** and paste it into the `scoring_endpoint` variable in this notebook.\n",
